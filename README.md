## Welcome to my **Conquering Machine Learning** series! 

With the introduction of tools like ChatGPT and Gemini, the world around us is changing quickly and Artificial Intelligence is being integrated to our everyday lives. More specifically, **Machine Learning** is quickly becoming an integral part of our digital infrastructure so it is vital we understand how to use it so we can further advance our society and solve large scale issues.

### Why use Conquering Machine Learning?

To give a quick background on myself, I'm a software engineer with 3+ years of experience and I've gone through many different machine learning courses and I felt that there wasn't a course that covered everything in a simple and easy to understand manner.
Sometimes the information would be too focused on the lingo and fancy jargon while other times the math would be intimidating to look at as they introduce so many equations and variables at once, expecting everyone to have some deep understanding of multivariable calculus beforehand.

In this series, I'll try to break everything down and make it simple enough so that even an 8th grader can go out and design, create, build, test and deploy their own ML models.

### Series Structure

This series will be broken down into two components: **Concepts** and **Code**

**Concepts** will cover all the theory and math behind the machine learning algorithms we discuss.

**Code** is where we will actually start building our own models and testing and deploying them. For this series, I will use [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (a machine learning framework) to run and test different types of algorithms. I will also provide any datasets I use for training and testing our models. Later on, I will use [AWS Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) to build, train, test and deploy our models.

### Notes

All the information and code will be written in Jupyter Notebooks. You can use many tools to open these notebooks, but I think a quick and easy way is to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

Remember to have fun with it and enjoy the information!
