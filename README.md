Welcome to my series on machine learning! I've gone through many machine learning courses and have read up on all the different things you can do in the world of machine learning so this is all going to be from my perspective, a guy who studied computer engineering in college and has 3+ years of experience working as a software engineer.

This series will be broken down into two areas: **Concepts** and **Code**

**Concepts** will cover all the theory and math behind the machine learning algorithms we discuss.

**Code** will use Python 3 and PyTorch (a machine learning framework) to run and test different types of algorithms
